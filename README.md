# Numerical_Method
This repository contains foundational numerical methods essential for understanding and developing engineering solvers. It covers iterative techniques, linear systems, and PDE-based methods, serving as a prerequisite for building advanced solver frameworks.
This repo includes the user defined function for Root-findind method (often used in finding roots of mathematical models) and linear algebric methods (used in discreatization methods such as FEM,FVM, CFD etc for solver-development).
